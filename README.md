### **Summary**

**JSON Web Token:**

JSON Web Token (JWT) is widely used for securing REST APIs, in terms of securely transmitting tokens along with HTTP requests, which facilitates stateless and secure communication between REST clients and API backend.

When a REST client invokes a protected API end point, it should put a JWT in the Authorization header of the request. If the server could verify the token, the request will be handled. Otherwise an HTTP status 401 (Unauthorized) is returned.
